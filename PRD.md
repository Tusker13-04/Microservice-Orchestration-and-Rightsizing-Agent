- **Complete scenario coverage**: Both browsing and checkout patterns tested

**Deliverables**:
- **Enhanced** automated data generation pipeline with triple-loop architecture
- **High-quality** isolated time-series datasets for each microservice
- **Robust** data validation and quality assurance tools with configurable thresholds
