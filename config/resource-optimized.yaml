# Resource-Optimized Configuration for MOrA Data Collection
# Designed to prevent system overload while maintaining data quality

training:
  steady_state_config:
    experiment_duration_minutes: 15  # Reduced from 45 to 15 minutes
    replica_counts: [1, 2, 4]        # Reduced from [1,2,4,6] to [1,2,4]
    load_levels_users: [5, 10, 20, 30, 50, 75]  # Reduced from [10,50,100,150,200,250]
    test_scenarios: ['browsing', 'checkout']  # Keep both scenarios

# Resource Limits
max_parallel_workers: 1          # Single worker to prevent resource overload
cpu_limit_per_worker: 2          # Maximum 2 CPU cores per worker
memory_limit_per_worker: 2       # Maximum 2GB RAM per worker

# Load Generation Optimization
jmeter_thread_ramp_up: 30        # Gradual ramp-up over 30 seconds
jmeter_thread_ramp_down: 30      # Gradual ramp-down over 30 seconds
jmeter_think_time: 2              # 2 seconds between requests

# Metrics Collection Optimization
metrics_collection_interval: 30   # Collect metrics every 30 seconds (reduced frequency)
prometheus_query_timeout: 10      # 10 second timeout for Prometheus queries
max_retries: 3                    # Maximum 3 retries for failed operations

# Data Storage Optimization
save_interval_minutes: 5          # Save data every 5 minutes
compress_data: true               # Compress stored data to save space
cleanup_temp_files: true          # Clean up temporary files immediately

# System Resource Monitoring
monitor_system_resources: true    # Monitor CPU/Memory usage
pause_if_high_usage: true         # Pause if system usage > 80%
high_usage_threshold: 80          # Threshold for pausing (CPU or Memory %)
